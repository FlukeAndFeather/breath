```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,
                      warning = FALSE)
library(breath)
library(quantreg)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
n_days <- last(bm181021_dives$data$dt) - first(bm181021_dives$data$dt)
n_dives <- bm181021_dives$data %>% 
  filter(diveid > 0) %>% 
  summarize(n = n_distinct(diveid)) %>% 
  pull(n)
n_breaths <- sum(bm181021_dives$data$is_breath)
n_lunges <- length(bm181021_dives$lunge_dt)
```

This analysis focuses on medium-term deployment **bm181021**, which lasted `r format(n_days, digits = 1)` days and included `r n_dives` dives, `r n_lunges` lunges, and `r n_breaths` breaths.

Here's an example of a dive event after breath and dive identification.

```{r}
plot_dive_event(bm181021_dives, 200, 60)
```

When an animal dives beyond its aerobic dive limit (ADL), we expect dives *shorter* than the ADL all have the same minimum recovery time and *longer* dives have an increasing minimum recovery time. For details, see Horning (2012).

![Minimum post-dive recovery times show a steep increase beyond the aerobic dive limit (Horning 2012, Figure 3)](horning_2012_fig3.png)

This whale shows the opposite trend, i.e. the minimum recovery time is increasing for dives shorter than the breakpoint and flat for longer. I think this means the animal is not approaching the ADL so we lack data on sufficiently long dives.

```{r}
fit_adl(bm181021_dives) %>%
  plot_adl()
```

This trend holds when we average duration and recovery over 6 dives.

```{r}
fit_adl(bm181021_dives, n_dives = 6) %>%
  plot_adl()
```
